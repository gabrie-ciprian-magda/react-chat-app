## Installation and setup

Clone or download the repository.
First navigate to the "server" folder and install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

In the root folder "/react-chat-app" install the packages

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the npm packages in both folders, start the server:
Navigate to the "server" folder and run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then in the root folder "/react-chat-app" start the react app:

```bash
npm start
```

To test the chat app, open two instances of the app in two separate tabs at http://localhost:3000/

Join a chat room by adding a random name in each tab, but make sure the "Chatroom Name" is the same in both tabs.

#Example:
in tab 1: Username: John / Chatroom Name: 1
in tab 2: Username: Doe / Chatroom Name: 1

5. Start chatting



## Run just the front end
In order to run just the front end, you can navigate to the "build" folder and run it in a server. You can use Visual Studio Code with the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
